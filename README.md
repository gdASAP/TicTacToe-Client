Game Rules:
This version of Tic-Tac-Toe can be played indepedently. Once signed in or signed up, the user can start a game. Once the game is started and game board appears the user will alternate between making moves for X and O. Messaging will show the user if either X or O has won, as well as if the game ends in a tie. The user may start a new game at any time and has the ability to leave games unfinished.

Technologies Used:
html, bootstrap css, JavaScript

Development process:
I planned to use callback functions, arrays and differnt files to separate concerns. I wanted to use variable names so that the next developer can easily understand what the variable represents. I also included comments.

I took each requirement and broke it down into pieces. I wrote down a step by step process from the user standpoint in psuedo code and developed the project in the order the user would encouter or need to use various functionality. After testing a functionality requirement, I committed the code.

For problem solving I used console log to see how data was formated, how I could manipulate it and to see how the project was progressing (which functions were being called, when they were being called etc.)

Future revisions and improvements:
-ability to view finished vs unfinished games
-ability to restart an unfinished game
-update game layout to match wireframes
-update the styling
-clean up the code
